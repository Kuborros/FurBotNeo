# FurbotNeo

An old discord bot made using Java, filled with references and "features".

Mostly learning ground for writing in java it holds basic functionality, as well as music playback and imageboard searches.

It uses database to track statistics and per guild configs, in varying state of use or completion.

There is no proper documentation of the code, shamefully commented version of code got lost in transition between pcs.

If this code helps you learn something that's great :3
And if you think its really bad.. well we all have to start somewhere, and skilled advice will be appreciated!

If using code from this repository, please mention me in the comments.

By default operates in SFW mode restricting access to more risky commands.
To change it use command ``!guildcfg nsfw true`` (replace "!" with used prefix).

## Configuration

### Global:

All **global** configuration options reside in ``config.json``. The file is autogenerated on first run, and has to be filled in with at least *bot token* obtained from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
Filling in *owner id* (obtained from discord client in developer mode) is also recommended. Remaining options are safe to remain in default settings unless needed.

When:
* ``"invidio" = true``, invidio.us will be used to proxy youtube links and searches. Best used when google hands out another banwave. Do note however, that this method is noticably slower than querying youtube directly.

* ``"shard" = true``, sharding will be used to handle bigger guild numbers. This feature is not completely tested.

* ``"shop" = true``, shop features will be enabled, as will token earnings for chatting.

* ``"buy_vip" = true``, VIP role will be purchasable using tokens. it is intended to provide extra features for long time community members. If disabled, everyone gets VIP features.


``blacklist_servers`` array alows you to ban guilds from your instance - bot will not join any of the servers added here.

### Local:

Per-guild configuration is available from ``guildcfg`` command.
Running the command with no parameters will list all available config options and their current values.


## Compilation instructions: 

Minimum JDK version required is **11**. (Current LTS release.)

_Use maven_ (Should be available in your distribution repositories.)

For simple compilation and package into .jar archives, run this command in project root directory:
```bash
mvn package
```
Output .jars will be placed in ``target`` directory.

Project is set so it can be ran directly without repackaging with 

```bash
mvn exec:java
```

## Libraries used:

* [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
* [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities)
* [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)
