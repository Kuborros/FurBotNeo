# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The current release (main branch) is considered "supported", as in the horrible bugs in it will be fixed.

Dev builds (dev branch) will have the latest fancy stuff and will likely get patches and fixes first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Just tell me please. Github or somewhere else will do.
